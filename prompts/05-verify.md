# Stage 05 — Verify

Goal: install dependencies, boot the dev environment, and confirm the **Verification gate** from `tech-stack.md` passes end-to-end.

## Inputs

- `tech-stack.md` — **Install command**, **Dev command**, and **Verification gate** sections drive this stage.
- `/app/` — the project as built by stages 01-04.

## Steps

1. Run the **Install command** from `tech-stack.md` in `/app/`. It must complete without errors.
2. Start the project with the **Dev command** from `tech-stack.md`. The server must boot without unhandled errors.
3. Hit the **Verification gate** endpoint from `tech-stack.md`. The response must match the body declared in that section exactly.
4. Open at least one frontend page from `pseudocode/<feature>/Frontend/` and confirm it loads — both the network request to the API and the rendered output.
5. If any of steps 1-4 fail, report which stage's output the failure traces back to (01 scaffold, 02 data, 03 logic, or 04 frontend) and stop. Do not silently patch around a stage's missing or incorrect output here.

## Success criterion

All four checks pass:
- Install completes cleanly.
- Dev server boots cleanly.
- The **Verification gate** endpoint returns the declared response.
- At least one feature page loads end-to-end.

This is the final pass/fail for the whole bundle. If green, the build is complete.
